# shape-ocr-detect-model
Using a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM and a CA1507 camera, equipped with the PaddleOCR algorithm (in a Paddle-Lite environment), enables the recognition of object dimensions and OCR code information. This solution can be applied as a universal model for recognizing and extracting text from all languages.
